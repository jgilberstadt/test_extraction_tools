Load fsl as a module
Use a set of skullstripped images as an input for flirt
Run the command flirt -in inputvol -ref refvol -omat outputmatrix to produce an affine matrix
Use avscale to find the determinant of the affine matrix. The reciprocal of the determinant is called the Atlas Scaling Factor (ASF)
Divide the volume of a template atlas mask by the ASF to obtain the eTIV (equivalent of ICV)
